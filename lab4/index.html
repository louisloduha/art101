					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Creating pseudocode for random tasks and simple games.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Making sure my pseudocode was meaningful and effective was a challenge. I didn't just want to be making some dumb list.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment helped me become more aware of how to make pseudocode effective and ready to be used when we begin actually coding.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>

					<p>Here is my javascript commment code:</p>
					<pre><code>
						// Create values for rock, paper and scissors
						// Create functions for rock, paper and scissors
						  // This means, rock>scissors, scissors>paper, paper>rock
						  // Same = same is a tie
						// Make 2 player system
						  // Each player can select 1 of the 3 values
						  // They go head to head and the functions decide the result, (win, lose, tie)
						  // Ask both players to play again
						  // Repeat if yes
						// Quit game if either player says no to playing again
					</pre></code>
